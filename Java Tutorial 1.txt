Java source code is translated into (bytecode) when compiled without any errors.

A (block) is a group of programming statements surrounded by braces.

Programming errors can be categorized into three types: (syntax errors, runtime errors, and logic errors.)

Errors detected by the compiler are known as (syntax errors or compile-time errors.)

(Runtime) errors are errors that cause a program to terminate abnormally and occur while a program is running if the environment detects an operation that is impossible to carry out.
